#### 1. OneTrust
I developed this integration in order to better utilize the OneTrust APIs within XSOAR for risk assessement intake as an incident. This was part of a migration from excel supported CyberRisk process to XSOAR.
This integration is working with the following APIs:
- Get Assessment List
- Get Assessment Details
- Send Back Assessment Under Review to In Progress
- Update Assessment Tags(In development)
